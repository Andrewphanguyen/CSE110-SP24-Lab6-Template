Check Your Understanding

1) I would fit my automated testing in within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed becuase the code could be tested automatically and be up to date which helps get immediate feedback in order to address errors more clearly and catch onotice bugs. While there is a arguement that suggest testing locally is good, testing on Github actions allows members to be notified of bugs happening and detect errors early in the development process without breaking the whole system which makes it more consistent. And running all tests at the same time could lead to a lot of unnoticed bugs happening.




2) No because end to end test is usually used for testing the whole application of the code rather then specific parts of the code. Testing this way doesn't show specific errors occurring and is very vague with why certain functions are happening. If we want to test a function specfically we would just use a Unit test to test that specific function since it is less syntax, more simpler, and better for testing individual parts of the code with whatever input we want to use.
