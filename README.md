1) I would fit my automated testing in manually run them locally before pushing code becuase the code could be tested automatically and be up to date which helps get immediate feedback in order to address errors more clearly and catch onotice bugs. Also if the code were to be pushed, it saves the code and can create a lot of bugs when combined with the rest of the code.
